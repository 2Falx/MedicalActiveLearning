Check the train_active_learning function:

Problem: 
The train_active_learning function use the whole(!!) training dataset and then select the most uncertainty images from the test dataset to be added to the training dataset.
Possible solution:
You should mantain always the same test dataset and start the recursive active learning training using a small portion (e.g. 20%) of the whole training dataset, labelled training dataset.
Then compute the uncertainty measure for the remaining 80% of the training dataset, unlabeled training dataset, and add the most uncertainty images to the labelled training dataset.
Iterate this process untill the unlabeled training dataset is empty.
Then test of the test set.
